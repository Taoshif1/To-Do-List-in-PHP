Welcome to my very first **CRUD-based Todo List Web App**—a simple yet powerful project built with **PHP** and **MySQL** on the backend, and **HTML/CSS** on the frontend. This was more than just a basic web app for me—this was a challenge, a learning experience, and proof that I'm growing every single day as a developer.

## 💡 About the Project

This Todo List app allows you to:

- ✅ **Create** tasks
- 🚫 **Delete** tasks
- ✔️ **Mark tasks as complete**
- 📋 See all your tasks listed from newest to oldest

All tasks are stored in a **MySQL database**, and the app dynamically updates the UI based on the current task status. Simple, clean, and fully functional.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS  
- **Backend**: PHP  
- **Database**: MySQL  
- **Local Server**: XAMPP

## 🌱 What I Learned

Building this wasn’t just about code—it was about mindset.

I had to:
- Deal with confusing PHP syntax (trust me, those semicolons tried to break me 😤)
- Understand how GET and POST methods work
- Write clean SQL queries
- Use PHP with MySQLi for database integration
- Handle form submissions and page redirects smoothly
- Learn the beauty of `while` loops for dynamically rendering content

## 🤝 My Developer Mindset

This app represents my **dedication**, **consistency**, and **fire to learn**. I know I have a long way to go, but this is a **solid step forward**. Every bug fixed and every feature added makes me a better programmer.

I’m not just coding.  
I’m **building a future**—one project at a time.
